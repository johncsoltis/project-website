    <h1> Digging into the DEA Opiate Database</h1>

<h2> Project Overview</h2>
    <p> The goal of this project was to use the DEA opiate database and the US Census data to try and identify
        socioeconomic factors that have any correlations to opiate ussage
    </p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/?utm_term=.8654ced443f9
            ", target = "_blank">DEA Database</a></li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.census.gov/developers", target = "_blank">US Census API</a></li>
      </ul>

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>Counties with lower incomes and counties whose residents work construction jobs will typically correlate with higher opiate distribution rates.
    </p>


<h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>As expected, the gross number of pills distributed is highest in urban areas but once the population is taken into account, 
    the per capita concentrations tend to increase in the surrounding counties.

    <br>
    <p>There are no overwhelmingly strong correlations observed. The strongest with a 0.6 correlation coefficient is STEM Jobs and Average Income. 
        Interestingly pill quantity correlates positively with STEM jobs per capita and negatively with Construction jobs per capita.
    </p>

<h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p>80GB DEA database was too large to handle normally and had to be broken down into multiple smaller files and then parsed into state level files to be useable in Pandas
        The DEA database had very poor documentation
    </p>
    <br>

<h2>Conclusions and Further Work</h2>
    <p>No clear or statistically significant correlations in the observed census data to opiate distribution
        Contrary to our hypothesis, construction jobs have a negative correlation to opiate distribution while STEM jobs have a positive correlation
        Next steps would be to evaluate opiate related overdoses and deaths and work to correlate to distribution numbers and population to try and find where opiates are being appropriately prescribed rather than abused.
